# Face Attendance System

A face attendance system using **MTCNN / facenet** and **FaceNet / dlib** and other advance models for face recognition.

## Features
- Detects faces from images
- Generates face embeddings
- Compares faces and marks attendance
- Supports multiple recognition algorithms

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MTCNN
- FaceNet
- dlib (face_recognition)

## How It Works
1. Detect face using MTCNN  
2. Extract face embeddings  
3. Compare with known faces  
4. Mark attendance
